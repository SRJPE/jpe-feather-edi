## Trap equipment

Three 8-foot rotary screw traps were used.

## Current trap locations

Theree are two curent trap locations: Low Flow Channel (1 RST at Eye Riffle site near RM 60.2) and High Flow Channel (2 RSTs in tandem at Herringer Riffle near RM 45.7).

## Historical trap locations

Low Flow Channel historical trap locations are Steep Riffle site near RM 61 and Gateway Riffle site near RM 59.5.

High Flow Channel historical trap locations are Live Oak site near RM 42 and Sunset Pumps site near RM 38.

## Monitoring schedule

From November to July. Continuously trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions. Serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch

## Daily environmental data

Daily environmental data collected are water temperature (Celsius) and turbidity (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). 

## Fish measurements

Fork length measurements to nearest mm taken for Chinook (50 randomly selected of each run type, run determined by Greene 1992 Length-at-Date chart), Steelhead (first 50), and non-salmonids (up to 20).

## Fish counts

All fish not measured are plus counted by hand. If juvenile salmon are highly abundant, a simple volume displacement method is used to count fall-run Chinook in increments of 500-1,000 or more to speed up processing. Efforts are made to ensure welfare of fish is maintained during capture and handling; however, fish may be affected by other pathogens and disease which may increase the possibility of mortality.

## Trap efficiency trials

Natural origin fall-run captured in RSTs are the primary source of released fish. At least once weekly December-April across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals allow. A minimum of 3 consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for a release to be included in analysis. Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. Release site approximately 0.5 miles upstream of each trap site.

## Trap efficiency mark rotation

Fish are marked with a colored Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE), and/or a Bismarck brown Y (BBY) whole body stain. Elastomer colors and/or marking locations on the fish are used to create unique marks. A unique mark is not used again for 7 days to ensure release groups of the same mark do not overlap.
